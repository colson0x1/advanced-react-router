# Advanced React Router DOM

Configure Routes and make sure different Components are loaded for different
paths, handle route and page errors, layout that wraps itself around multiple
routes, nested routes and data fetching and submission with loaders and actions,
advanced use cases like useFetcher to load data behind the scnes without
navigating, deferring data fetching which can be helpful if we have some slow
requests some slow backend and we wanna show a page without waiting for the
data to be there or if we have multiple pieces of data and we wanna show some
data before all the data is there.
